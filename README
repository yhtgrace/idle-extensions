Provides the following third-party extensions for Idle:
    - StyleCheck runs pep8 style checker on current module
    - DocTest runs doctests (with verbose option
        set to true) on current module
    - Both print output to a new output window
The extensions are currently compatible in Idlex. 

There's an install script INSTALL that works in 
Lubuntu. (Written by Peter Froehlich, thanks Dr. Froehlich!) 

Otherwise, there are 2 ways to install:
- First install pep8 (In unix this is
    sudo apt-get install pep8
1) With idlex
    - Install idlex
    - Copy StyleCheck.py and DocTest.py into idlexlib
2) Without idlex
    - Append config-extensions .cfg to ~/.idlerc/config-extensions.cfg
      (If it doesn't exist yet copy the file over)
    - Copy StyleCheck.py and DocTest.py into idlelib/extensions
      which is found in the Python directory
      (On my Mac this is /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/
                      Versions/2.7/lib/python2.7/idlelib)
      This requires root access (sudo). 

ExampleDocTest.py is an example module from the Python documentation
for the doctest module. It was used to run tests on the extensions. 
It isn't needed for the extensions to work. 

10/04/12:
    - Fixed bug where doctest outputs to stderr, resulting in nothing
      in the output window
    - Fixed bug where extensions run on saved, unmodified file even
      though the file has been modified

To do:
    - Make the new output window un-editable
    - Implement key-bindings (shortcuts to StyleCheck and DocTests
