Provides the following third-party extensions for Idle:
    - StyleCheck runs pep8 style checker on current module
    - DocTest runs doctests (with verbose option
        set to true) on current module
    - Both print output to a new output window
The extensions are currently compatible in Idlex. 

Installation instructions that should probably be broken down into 
simpler steps:
    - Install pep8
    - Append config-extensions.cfg to ~/.idlerc/config-extensions.cfg
      (Although in this case it probably doesn't exist yet, so just create a new file)
    - Copy StyleCheck.py and DocTest.py into idlelib/extensions
      (Probably requires sudo-- work around?)
Or if working with idlex
    - Install pep8 
    - Install idlex
    - Copy StyleCheck.py and DocTest.py into idlexlib

In Lubuntu:
cd the-folder-you-just-extracted
sudo apt-get install pep8
cat config-extensions.cfg >> ~/.idlerc/config-extensions.cfg 
sudo cp *.py /usr/lib/python2.7/idlelib

ExampleDocTest.py is an example module from the Python documentation
for the doctest module. It was used to run tests on the extensions. 

To do:
    - Have students install idlex instead? There's lots of nice extensions
      there that could be helpful for them. That would involve figuring out
      the licensing if packaging together
    - Make the new output window un-editable
    - Implement key-bindings (shortcuts to StyleCheck and DocTests)
