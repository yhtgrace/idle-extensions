Provides the following third-party extensions for Idle:
    - StyleCheck runs pep8 style checker on current module
    - DocTest runs doctests (with verbose and report options 
        set to true) on current module
The extensions are currently compatible in Idlex. 

Installation instructions that should probably be broken down into 
simpler steps:
    - Install pep8
    - Append config-extensions.cfg to ~/.idlerc/config-extensions.cfg
      (Although in this case it probably doesn't exist yet, so just create a new file)
    - Copy StyleCheck.py and DocTest.py into idlelib/extensions
      (Probably requires sudo-- work around?)
Or if working with idlex
    - Install pep8
    - Install idlex
    - Copy StyleCheck.py and DocTest.py into idlexlib
See about packaging extensions together with idlex for distribution under idlex license?

To do:
    - Have students install idlex instead? There's lots of nice extensions
      there that could be helpful for them
    - Implement key-bindings (shortcuts to StyleCheck and DocTests)
    - Check if all this even works in lubuntu
